Based on: https://github.com/hedgesky/slime.tmbundle

## Configuration

I'm watching an issue that will allow user configurable language configuration of auto closing pairs. It's currently not supported in VSCode.

Until that is available, I've removed "->/end" "do/end" from automatically closing, as several users have complained about that.

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
